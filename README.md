# HTCondorReporter

A simple monitoring tool for jobs that were submitted to CERN's HTCondor infrastructure. It sends status reports to a Telegram bot.


# Quick setup guide

## Install dependencies

This tool requires the *requests* library. Install it by running
```
pip install --user requests
```


## Create and configure a Telegram bot

The setup of a Telegram bot requires two steps: getting an API token for your bot from Telegram and registering your bot connection details in `Tools/python/telegramUser.py`.

### Creating a Telegram bot and getting its API token

Visit telegram.me/botfather and type `/newbot`. Then, simply follow the instructions of the botfather.

You will receive an API token in this process. Keep it, we will need it in a minute!

Next, start chatting with your newly created bot by clicking the "t.me/[yourNewBot]" link which the botfather has sent in the same message that contained the API token.

As a last step, a user ID has to be retrieved. This ID can be found by visiting https://api.telegram.org/bot[yourAPItoken]/getUpdates, where you have to search for the integer number corresponding to the "id" of the chat with the user that will receive the notification messages (you need to send a message to the bot in order to find the entry).

Having obtained API token and user ID for your new Telegram bot, let's proceed to the final setup step.

### Registering your Telegram bot in the software

Copy the file `template.telegramUser.py` to `telegramUser.py`, open it and enter your API token and your user ID.

> Attention: Never push your `telegramUser.py` file to GitHub etc. as it contains sensitive information.


## Integration in CMSSW

If you are a CMS user, you might want to integrate this software into your CMSSW environment. To do this, simply move the entire folder with this software to the `src/` folder in your CMSSW release folder and compile with `scram b -j 8`.


# Running the software

In order to start monitoring your Condor jobs, go to `Tools/scripts/` and run
```./runCondorReporter.sh```
(or, if you have complied with `scram`, simply run `runCondorReporter.sh`).
